# OpSystems1-C
In this assignment, you will implement a command line interpreter (or a shell). The shell should operate in
this basic way: when you type in a command (in response to its prompt), the shell creates a child process that
executes the command you entered and then prompts for more user input when the child has finished. Simpler than, the shell we run every day in Unix.
